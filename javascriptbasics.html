         	<h2>JavaScripts Basics</h2>
         	<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bumch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environmet, (a web broswer or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environemnts to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					  <li><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identifiied with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <a id="purple">var x;</a></li>
					  <li><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can not have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. the = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<a id="purple">var x = 10;</a>< </li>
					  <li><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <a id="purple">true</a> or <a id="purple">false;</a> null <a id="purple">null</a> aka nothing; Number - <a id="purple">42</a> or <a id="purple">3.14159;</a> String - <a id="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</a> Array - <a id="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</a> and Object - <a id="purple">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</a></li>
					  <li><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <a id="purple">if</a> a speficied condition is true, do this code in your code block; <a id="purple">else if</a> to specify a new condition to test, if the first conditon is false; <a id="purple">else</a> we execute this block of code; </li>
					  <li><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imaging you have to fun a mile, well you run around the track 4 times and then you stop. Thats. loop!</li>
					  <li><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table to right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
